# Setup a Adafruit IO Account

*Adafruit is an Internet of Things platform where you can make online sensor data visible in a so called "feed"* 

You have to make an account if you want to make use of Adafruit IO. So the first step is to make an account with an dashboard.
1. Go to https://io.adafruit.com/ , click on "Get Started for free" and make an account.
2. Go to the left sidebar and click "Dashboards", create a new dashboard and give your dashboard a name. *If you don't see "Dashboard" in the left sidebar, make sure that you used the previous links. Make sure that you are not on https://www.adafruit.com/ .*
3. It's time to create a Adafruit IO Key. Look for the "Adafruit IO Keybutton" (AIO Key). Receive your key by clicking on the key button. *If you can't find the key button then it's also possible to go to "settings" in the menu on the left and find the AIO key there.*
4. Your AdafruitIO Key should appear on your screen. Make sure you don't forget to save te AIO key because you need it later.
5. Its time to make a feed. You can find "feeds" in the menu on the left. Make a new feed and call it "toggl". *You can give your feed a different name but it's easier for now to call it "toggle".*
